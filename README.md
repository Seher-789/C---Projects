#  C++ Daily Projects

##  Overview
Welcome to my **C++ Projects Repository** — a personal collection of beginner-to-intermediate level programs built while learning and practicing core C++ concepts.  
Each project focuses on improving **problem-solving**, **logic building**, and **code structuring** using modern C++ standards.

This repository showcases my **daily learning journey**, covering topics from basic syntax to applied problem-solving through small, functional programs.

##  Topics Covered
🔹 Data types, operators, and control structures  
🔹 Loops and recursion  
🔹 Functions and inline functions  
🔹 Classes, objects, and encapsulation  
🔹 File handling and input/output  
🔹 Type casting and data conversions  
🔹 Modular and menu-driven program design
